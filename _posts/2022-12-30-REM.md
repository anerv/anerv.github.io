As many others, I was quite intrigued by the many gorgeous maps of meandering rivers made with [Dan Coe's tutorial](<https://dancoecarto.com/creating-rems-in-qgis-the-idw-method>).

Here is my take on visualizing the Kennetcook and Five Mile River in Nova Scotia, based on a relative elevation model (REM). Made with QGIS and data from Government of Nova Scotia.
